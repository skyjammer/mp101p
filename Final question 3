In this problem you will update a document in the Enron dataset (which can be found here) to illustrate your mastery of updating documents from the shell.

Please add the email address "mrpotatohead@mongodb.com" to the list of addresses in the "headers.To" array for the document with "headers.Message-ID" of "<8147308.1075851042335.JavaMail.evans@thyme>"

After you have completed that task, please download final3-validate-mongo-shell.js from the Download Handout link and run

mongo final3-validate-mongo-shell.js

to get the validation code and put it in the box below without any extra spaces. The validation script assumes that it is connecting to a simple mongo instance on the standard port on localhost. 

Solution:
1. restore messages.bson
   $ mongorestore -d enron -c messages  messages.bson
2. run mongo
  >use enron
  >db.messages.update({ 'headers.Message-ID': '<8147308.1075851042335.JavaMail.evans@thyme>' }, { $addToSet: { 'headers.To': 'mrpotatohead@mongodb.com' } })
  
  note: the result should be
        WriteResult({ "nMatched" : 1, "nUpserted" : 0, "nModified" : 1 })

3.  $mongo final3-validate-mongo-shell.js
    Result: MongoDB shell version: 3.2.1
    MongoDB shell version: 3.2.1
